# Resume-Screening-Using-NLP-and-Multiple Machine-Learning-model
This project focuses on classifying resumes into specific job profiles (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Marketing Manager) based on the skills, experience, and qualifications mentioned in the resume. By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the model automatically categorizes resumes into the correct job profile.


# Overview
NLP Basics:

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning the raw text data from resumes by removing stop words, punctuation, and irrelevant information.
Tokenization and Lemmatization: Breaking down text into words or tokens, followed by reducing words to their base forms (lemmas).
Vectorization: Using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorization to convert text data into numerical features that machine learning models can process.
Machine Learning Models:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, yet effective algorithm that classifies resumes based on their proximity to other data points.
Random Forest: A versatile ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions for better accuracy.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classification algorithm that separates data points with the largest possible margin, leading to accurate predictions.
Model Evaluation:

All models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Comparison of models to see which performs best in terms of classification accuracy and generalization.
App Development:

Streamlit App: Developed an interactive web-based app using Streamlit to allow users to upload resumes and get instant classification results.
PyCharm IDE: The app and backend were developed in PyCharm, providing a seamless development environment for building and testing the machine learning models.
Applications:

The solution can be easily adapted for real-world recruitment processes.
It helps recruiters save time and effort by quickly identifying qualified candidates
